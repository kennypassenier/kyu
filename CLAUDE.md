# mailbox

A self-documenting message hub for the homelab: durable topics, named
subscriptions, send/receive/ack over plain HTTP, dashboard as
documentation. Rust; deployed as a Docker container in a Proxmox LXC.

This project follows the dev procedure in `~/Projects/dev-procedure/`
(`/project-flow`). Standing rules apply to every change:
`~/Projects/dev-procedure/STANDING_RULES.md`. Sessions may be opened
from anywhere — the gates live in git hooks, not in session config.

## Procedure status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Current phase | 6 · Development loop — all milestones built (L0–L8) |
| Last completed gate | L5 crash-safety (2026-08-12); L6–L8 built in AFK mode, awaiting the combined report |
| Next gate | Combined Phase 6 report for L6, L7 and L8 |
| AFK mode | on — L6–L8 accumulate into one combined report |

<!-- Update this block after every completed gate. -->

## Project documents

| Doc | Purpose |
|---|---|
| docs/SCOPE.md | goals, non-goals, success criteria, constraints (Phase 0) |
| docs/FEATURES.md | rated feature list with permanent IDs (Phase 2) |
| docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md | frozen AR decisions incl. tech choice (Phases 3-4) |
| docs/REALIZATION_PLAN.md | milestones + status table (Phase 5) |
| docs/TEST_PLAN.md | what is proven where + accepted limitations (Phase 7) |

## Gates (enforced)

Commits are blocked unless `.claude/hooks/gates.sh` passes and the
message carries IDs in brackets (`[K6, AR9]`, `[L4]`, `[meta]`).
Enforced twice over:

- **`.githooks/pre-commit` + `.githooks/commit-msg`** — repo-scoped, so
  they fire for every commit from any session, terminal or tool. A fresh
  clone activates them with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- **`.claude/hooks/check-commit.sh`** via `.claude/settings.json` — the
  same two gates for sessions opened in this directory.

CI re-runs everything on every push; red CI blocks the next commit.
